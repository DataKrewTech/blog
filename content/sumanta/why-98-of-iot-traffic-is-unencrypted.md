A March 2020 publication by [Unit 42 of Palo Alto Networks](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/) has reported the analysis results of 1.2 million IoT devices from over thousands of physical locations across enterprise IT and healthcare organizations in the United States. The objective was to identify the top IoT threats and provide recommendations that organizations can take to immediately reduce IoT risk in their environments. The results of the report is no less than shocking, and a timely alarm for a much needed paradigm shift in today's IoT ecosystem.

Below are some key findings of the study.
